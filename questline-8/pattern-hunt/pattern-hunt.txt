                                   Pattern Hunt
Find the next two terms in the sequence:
2, 6, 12, 20, ...

Answer: 30, 42

Two ways:
Method 1:
1st element is 2
6 is produced by adding 4 to 2
12 is produced by adding 6 to 6.
20 is produced by adding 8 to 12.
Here we see a pattern that is: the increment keeps on getting added by 2 and that no: is added to the previous no:
Therefore, next no: is produced by adding 10 to 20 = 30
And next by adding 12 to 30 =42

Method 2:
They are the products of 2 consecutive no:s of natural no: 
1x2 =2
2x3=6
3x4=12
4x5=20
Therefore the next 2 terms would be:
5x6= 30
6x7= 42
