
Manually trace the execution of a given pseudocode snippet to predict its output.
A = 5
B = 3
SUM = 0
print("Initial: A =", A, ", B =", B, ", SUM =", SUM)
for i in range(1, B + 1):
    print(f"\nStep {i}:")
    print("Before: SUM =", SUM)
    SUM = SUM + A
    print(f"Operation: SUM = SUM + A ? {SUM}")
print("\nFinal Output:", SUM)

TraceTable:

1. It will print:
Initial: A = 5 , B = 3 , SUM = 0
2. Loop will run from (1,B+1) so from i=1 to 3(since loop ends 1 no: before last range, here :4)
3. When i=1
It will print:
Step 1:
Before: SUM = 0
4. Then it will execute: SUM=SUM+A Therefore: SUM= 0+5=5
It will print:
Operation: SUM = SUM + A ?5
5. When i=2
It will print:
Step 2:
Before: SUM=5
6. Then it will execute: SUM=SUM+A Therefore: SUM= 5+5=10
It will print:
Operation: SUM = SUM + A ?10
7. When i=3
It will print:
Step 3:
Before: SUM=10
8. Then it will execute: SUM=SUM+A Therefore: SUM= 10+5=15
It will print:
Operation: SUM = SUM + A ?15
9. It will print:
Final Output: 15


Final output printed:

Initial: A = 5 , B = 3 , SUM = 0

Step 1:
Before: SUM = 0
Operation: SUM = SUM + A ?5

Step 2:
Before: SUM=5
Operation: SUM = SUM + A ?10

Step 3:
Before: SUM=10
Operation: SUM = SUM + A ?15

Final Output: 15
