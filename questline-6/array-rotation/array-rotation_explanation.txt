CODE:
num=list(map(int,input("enter no: with sapce in btw ").split()))
print("num=",num)
k=int(input("enter a no:"))
num=num[-k:]+num[:-k]
print("rotated array is ",num)

EXPLANATION:
num=list(map(int,input("enter no: with sapce in btw ").split()))
                            #map(function,iterable) is used to make all the elements as integers.  
                           #.split() is used to properly split the integers, or space will also be taken into account ,    making an error since it is not int.
                          #list is used to make the no: into a list.
print("num=",num)         #prints the entered no:s as a list
k=int(input("enter a no:"))  #asks user to enter how many place to rotate
num=num[-k:]+num[:-k]     
                                                      #num[-k:] gets all the last k elements                                     
                                                                  #   num[:-k]gets all the elements except last k elements.
                                                                  # then adds the last k elements before the others ,                                                         thus making k right rotations 
print("rotated array is ",num)   #prints the rotated array
