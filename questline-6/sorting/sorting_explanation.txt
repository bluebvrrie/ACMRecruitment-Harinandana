Code:
num=list(map(int,input("enter no:s with space in btw ").split()))
                        # input func asks the user for no:s 
                            #map will map the input as integers
                            #split will help regard them as integers and not as string. And will not make errors if space is read in between
                           #list func makes them into a list
n=len(num)    #calculates how many no:s are entered
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(0,n-i-1):
        if num[j] > num[j+1]:
            a= num[j]
            num[j]= num[j+1]
            num[j+1]= a
                                    # range (0,n-i-1) makes value of j from 0 to the 2nd last element, or the element before the sorted element each time.
                                            And checks if the 1st element is greater than the 2nd.If it is they are immediately swapped correctly.
                                     #As each turn completes the last element gets sorted   
                                     # it runs till the 1st element is sorted                  
print("Sorted array:",num)
               
TraceTable:
eg: num=[3,7,2,9]
Step1:
 When i=0,    range of j=(0,4-0-1)=(0,3)
      When j=0, num[0]=3, num[1]=7
                            3>7 is false
Therefore remains as such
         When j=1, num[1]=7, num[2]=2
                                 7>2 is true
Therefore,    num[1]=2 and num[2]=7
        Hence 7 got sorted
Step2:
 When i=1,    range of j=(0,4-1-1)=(0,2)
      When j=0, num[0]=3, num[1]=2
                            3>2 is true
Therefore,    num[0]=2 and num[1]=3
         When j=1, num[1]=3, num[2]=7
                                 3>7 is false
Therefore, no change
        Hence 3 got sorted
Step3:
 When i=2,    range of j=(0,4-2-1)=(0,1)
      When j=0, num[0]=2, num[1]=3
                            2>3 is false
Therefore,    no change
         Hence all are sorted.

FINAL OUTPUT PRINTED:
Sorted array:  [2, 3, 7, 9]
