Code: largest = second = -9999999
New code: largest = second = float('-inf')
Explanation: if we input no less than -9999999 the code wouldn't work.

Code:  elif num > second:
New code:  elif num > second and num!=largest:
Explanation: if duplicates of the largest no: is in there, then second largest will also be given to that no:
New code checks if the no: is equal to the largest no: thus preventing duplicate no: to be taken.
